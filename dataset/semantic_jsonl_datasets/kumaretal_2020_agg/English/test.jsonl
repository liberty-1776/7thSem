 \n  \nnext, i began noticing my underwear being stolen , never had this issue ever.  \n  \nthen this girl began spamming me wierd messages which got me pissed. then she\nleft back for new delhi, she would video call me late at night in very\nrevealing outfits and i didn't quite like it. but i never had anything in my\nmind so, i ignored it.  \n  \nthe she began repeated visits all the way from new delhi to my neighbours (her\nuncle) every fucking weekend , and would simply enter my house.  \n  \none day, i was having sex with my new date (a man) , thankfully, i kept the\nbedroom locked and this girl knocked it and stood out until i opened it , it\nwas so displeasing, that we had to dress up fast and act as if we were\ndrinking and having a good male time together. only to open the door and see\nher completely naked ,right in front of my bedroom with me and my male\ncompanion looking in utter shock. she didn't expect another male in the house\nsince i was the lonely tenant. i realised this girl is a weirdo and i began\nlocking my doors, would sleep at one of my hookup friends or mates or just\nanyone else's house at night on weekends because she would come to visit me,\nchanged my number, everything.  \n  \none fine day, she dropped in with her cousins and began shouting at me at my\nhouse by collecting everyone, and my father visited me all the way from surat\n, gujarat that morning, she kept saying everyone that i tricked her and had\nsex under the context of relationship and showed screenshots of me on my\nwhatsapp messenger videos, what's even more surprising is that she took\npictures of me while i was in shower oneday in the naked, she showed our\nlengthy conversations at night etc. she found my new number from someone in my\noffice by visiting and stalking me and sent me threatening messages of\nalleging molestation and rape charges against her.  \n  \ni was so shocked and almost about to cry that i was being a friend to her as\nshe was in a horrible marriage and having divorce with her now husband\nalready, and that he used to beat her up and all that.  \n  \ni decided that's it's enough and i made my mind that i won't take this\natrocious behaviour towards me since my elder brother was himself a victim of\n\"false rape charges\" against him , i collected the entire world including my\nrelatives my office mates, my friends all over the digital world, the society\nmembers, and guess what ? **i came out as a gay man because i had no choice**  \n  \ni opened up about my sexuality and everything to everyone including my parents\n, my brothers, my boss, my teachers , everyone !  \ni was not going to take this woman's shit anymore.  \n  \ni showed all my sex chats to the world with all the men i had it with, called\nall the guys whom i hooked up with, showed all my pictures of me being gay\never since i realised my sexuality at age 14 and the bullying i suffered as a\nchild. i didn't stop there !

 \n  \ngay men (90% of the time) are masculine and you would never even know that\nthey're gay until they say it themselves. most indian gay men by age 35 ,\nalmost 99% marry women to hide their sexuality. i'm of the remainder 1% who\nare proud of themselves.  \n  \nfound out this woman had a child already 5 years younger to me , already.  \n  \nlesson learnt :  \nnever even befriend a girl or be her companion in her bad times, you might end\nup being called a rapist. lol, i can't even imagine seeing a woman nude , let\nalone touching her , i literally keep a hand on the part in the porn where\nnaked girls are around hot naked men to avoid any visual encounter.  \n  \nmy heart beats out for all my heterosexual brothers who have faced such female\nmolestation or rape charges, even worse if they ever consensual sex , because\nthe man is screwed now for life ! i saved myself because i was gay , ya'll\nhave no hopes !  \ni also feel bad for girls who have been victims of rape by men, i won't be\nbiased at all. women do face more of sexual assaults than us men do, no point\nin denial but there are many a times , men are victims of it themselves.  \n  \nimagine. showing your relatives, your sex videos with other people to prove\nyour sexuality just **so that nobody calls me a rapist**  \ni knew those charges would be useless but once an allegation always is a\ncharge especially if it's a male. \"woh dekho wo launde ko, shadi shuda aurat\nka rape kiya usne\"  \nnobody would believe me even if i were to be free from all that legally. took\nquick action, saved my family from all that shame .  \n  \ni'm not ashamed of being a gay man, because i made my life out being called a\nchakka, hijda, what not by my own brothers, nobody accepted me not even my\nstraight bestfriend as i grew up because i trusted them and they ditched me ,\nas a result i began engulfing my own self either by suffering it or having sex\nwith other men who would comfort me or play with me for some days in my\nteenage years and support me emotionally and cry lonely in the showers and\nbeat myself ,cursing being a unlucky shame to the family. while my brothers\nwho did nothing significant didn't have to prove themselves just because\nthey're straight.  \n  \nmany of my relatives distanced me since we are a conservative family what\nmatters is my own family, took no shame of me. my employers know my hardwork,\nmy friends know my value, my neighbours know my support.  \nfound immense respect socially. actually ,even more after coming out.  \n  \nmy prayers with all rape victims of whatever gender, even more with the gay\nmen because nobody even reports it if it has been done out of society. most of\nteenage gay men are sexually assaulted by their own heterosexual cousins or\nhad some encounter. you have no idea the trauma gay men suffer as children\nbeing excluded from the world. drying within, most marry women by adulthood\njust so that their parents have their dreams fulfilled , drinking their own\nself sacrifice of being at freewill as venom. don't blame them, blame each and\nevery indian citizen for that.  \nimagine being a victim , where court deemed us as criminals, religions\nadmonished us, families throwing us out, brothers beating us, our mothers love\nus but they have no choice .  \n  \ngod bless you if you've read this far. i'm just like your brother, son, begin\naccepting us for who we are , this will save a lot of devastation from your\nown human fellow being.", "langids": null, "label": "CAG", "seq_labels": null, "text_pp": "** l am a male victim of fake female rape charges ** there was this girl who came from new delhi to stay at my neighbours house with her cousins for a few weeks and we accidentally clicked and we began eating out , watching movies , shopping , etc . she would call me at night and we would talk and laugh etc . as we stayed in the same floor  , she would directly pop into my house without knocking . fast forward , i was having a shower after my grindr hookup  ( a gay guy ) went away , now since i stay alone , i don't worry roaming around in the naked , i was having my shower and she stood there watching me , the moment i noticed  , she acted as if she accidentally saw it . this was so uncomfortable  !! next , i began noticing my underwear being stolen  , never had this issue ever . then this girl began spamming me wierd messages which got me pissed . then she left back for new delhi , she would video call me late at night in very revealing outfits and i didn't quite like it . but i never had anything in my mind so , i ignored it . the she began repeated visits all the way from new delhi to my neighbours  ( her uncle ) every fucking weekend  , and would simply enter my house . one day , i was having sex with my new date  ( a man ) , thankfully , i kept the bedroom locked and this girl knocked it and stood out until i opened it  , it was so displeasing , that we had to dress up fast and act as if we were drinking and having a good male time together . only to open the door and see her completely naked  , right in front of my bedroom with me and my male companion looking in utter shock . she didn't expect another male in the house since i was the lonely tenant . i realised this girl is a weirdo and i began locking my doors , would sleep at one of my hookup friends or mates or just anyone else's house at night on weekends because she would come to visit me , changed my number , everything . one fine day , she dropped in with her cousins and began shouting at me at my house by collecting everyone , and my father visited me all the way from surat  , gujarat that morning , she kept saying everyone that i tricked her and had sex under the context of relationship and showed screenshots of me on my whatsapp messenger videos , what's even more surprising is that she took pictures of me while i was in shower oneday in the naked , she showed our lengthy conversations at night etc . she found my new number from someone in my office by visiting and stalking me and sent me threatening messages of alleging molestation and rape charges against her . i was so shocked and almost about to cry that i was being a friend to her as she was in a horrible marriage and having divorce with her now husband already , and that he used to beat her up and all that . i decided that's it's enough and i made my mind that i won't take this atrocious behaviour towards me since my elder brother was himself a victim of  \" false rape charges \" against him  , i collected the entire world including my relatives my office mates , my friends all over the digital world , the society members , and guess what  ? ** i came out as a gay man because i had no choice ** i opened up about my sexuality and everything to everyone including my parents  , my brothers , my boss , my teachers  , everyone  ! i was not going to take this woman's shit anymore . i showed all my sex chats to the world with all the men i had it with , called all the guys whom i hooked up with , showed all my pictures of me being gay ever since i realised my sexuality at age 14 and the bullying i suffered as a child . i didn't stop there  ! i called up my ex and asked him to show the videos were we kissed , had cosy consented adult time together , showed proofs of gay bar visits in us  , finland , israel and all places that i visited . and asked her if she wanted to really marry me if i keep having sex with men and be her husband at the same time , she was even more shocked than she could ever even dream of  !
